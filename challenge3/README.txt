This is a code comprehension challenge. 
1. Clone the challenge3 folder
2. Read through the code
3. Leave comments describing what the code does. 

Your goal should be for another developer coming behind you to be able to understand the purpose of the code quickly. 
You are not required to understand the ins and outs of the code, just the general purpose and thinking behind it.
